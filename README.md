  <summary>What is Free Software?</summary>

### Free Software means that the user has the freedom to Run, Copy, Distribute, Study, Change and Improve the software.

There are some main essential freedoms as follows.

## Freedom 1
The Freedom to RUN the program as you wish, for any purpose

## Freedom 2
The Freedom to STUDY how the program works, and CHANGE it so it does your computing as you wish.
Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

## Freedom 3
The Freedom to REDISTRIBUTE copies so you can help your neighbour.

## Freedom 4
The Freedom to DISTRIBUTE copies of your MODIFIED versions to others.
By doing this you can give the whole community a change to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

<details>
  <summary>What is Open-Source Software?</summary>
  
Open-source software is a type of computer software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.

  <summary>Open-Source and Privacy</summary>
  
If you are extremely focused on privacy, open-source is the only way to go – We'll take VPN as an example.

* You can fully check the code on your own to make sure everything is good.
* Open-source VPN clients mean there is no risk that there are vulnerabilities or hidden backdoors in the code.

If you’re the kind of person who needs to have full control over their Internet privacy, open-source options are simply better for your sanity.

# Linux

Linux is a community of open-source Unix-like operating systems that are based on the Linux Kernel. It was initially released by Linus Torvalds on September 17, 1991. It is a free and open-source operating system and the source code can be modified and distributed to anyone commercially or noncommercially under the GNU General Public License.

## Architecture of Linux

Linux architecture has a few components.

### Hardware Layer
This layer consists of all peripheral devices like RAM/ HDD/ CPU etc.

### Kernel
The kernel is the core of the Linux-based operating system. The kernel is also responsible for preventing and mitigating conflicts between different processes. 

### Syscalls
Is the special types of functions that are used to implement the functionality of the operating system.

### System Utility
It provides the functionalities of an operating system to the user.

### Shell 
It is an interface to the kernel which hides the complexity of the kernel’s functions from the users. It takes commands from the user and executes the kernel’s functions.





## Package Managers
In Linux Package Managers are essentially software applications that help users Search, Download, Install, Remove and Update software applications on their computer operating system. 

There are two major Linux package managers,
* Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) 
* Debian GNU/Linux Package Manager.


## Linux Commands
* Make or create a directory
* Change Directory
* Copy file
* Move file
* Edit File
